An HTTP Server made in Rust for fun.
## Why I created this library
I have created this library because I wanted to learn how an http server works and how people make new ones. I have not created this with the aim of substituting Hyper or any other Rust HTTP library. It's mainly an educational project.
## Source of Inspiration
The style used in this library is similar to the Go HTTP library due to the fact that I find it awesome.
## Status of the project
The project is not even in an MVP stage. It doesn't comply to the HTTP protocol and I still need to add different features.
## If you want to get involved
In case you like the idea of porting something similar to the golang HTTP library to Rust or if you want to experiment with creating a new HTTP Library from scratch just make a pull request or contact me!
